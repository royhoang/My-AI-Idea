Building AI Course Project: Automating Environmental Monitoring in System Evaluations

Summary

In this project, AI will be trained to automate the monitoring and analysis of environmental data, to increase the efficiency of environmental systems assessments. The tool automatically detects environmental factors that have the potential to have a negative impact and extracts the necessary data from multiple sources to create consolidated reports, minimizing the time needed for the first steps in the evaluation process.

Background

Environmental monitoring in systematic assessments often requires a lot of effort and time, especially when collecting and analyzing data from various sources. This process is often complex and expensive and requires the expertise of environmental scientists. Automating this process's early steps saves time and allows researchers to focus on in-depth analysis and draw more meaningful conclusions.

How to use

The proposed AI will be used by environmental organizations, regulators, and scientists to monitor and assess the ecological impact of human activities. This tool can help detect potential problems early and provide scientific evidence to support decision and policy making.

Data sources and AI methods

Data will be collected from environmental sensors, monitoring reports, and public databases such as EPA and NASA. Will be used to analyze and extract information from big data, and identify patterns and trends.

Challenge

A major challenge is ensuring the accuracy and reliability of automatically collected data, as errors can lead to misunderstandings and poor decisions in environmental management. In addition, integrating and standardizing data from many different sources is also a challenge.


Develop AI models based on initial data sets and conduct tests to evaluate effectiveness and accuracy. Based on the results, the model will be refined to improve detection and analysis.
